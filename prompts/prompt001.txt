Full-body fashion photograph of a person in a surreal, immersive room where the walls, floor, and ceiling are painted bright cyan and covered in giant, 3D-painted red cherries and yellow banana peels. The person wears a monochromatic white suit and stands atop a yellow leopard-print upright piano. Surrounding the piano on the floor are several life-sized, realistic ceramic leopard statues. The person is captured in a joyful, high-energy pose with their arms wide and a wide expression. The lighting is bright, even, and "poppy," with no harsh shadows, making the colors look like a graphic illustration while maintaining photographic skin and fabric textures. The camera is positioned at a wide angle from the corner of the room to emphasize the dizzying, repetitive pattern of the fruit and animals.
