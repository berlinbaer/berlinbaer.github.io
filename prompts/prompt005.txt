Full-body fashion photograph of a person sitting on a wooden chair atop a gray industrial counter in a wood-paneled "trophy room." they are styled in a 1970s-inspired look: a cream and brown short-sleeve button-down shirt with a navy collar, patterned blue and black floral shorts, white mid-calf socks, and polished dark-burgundy loafers with white decorative fringe. the person is wearing oversized clear-lens aviator glasses and a navy patterned neckerchief. The background is filled with various gold and silver trophies and athletic statues. The lighting is soft and naturalistic, as if coming from an overhead office light, creating gentle shadows and preserving the warm tones of the wood and the cream fabric. The camera is at a medium-distance, eye-level, using a 35mm lens to capture the subject's relaxed posture and the surrounding trophies in a clean, editorial layout.
