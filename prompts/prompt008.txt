Tight-cropped fashion portrait of a person wearing a high-gloss, gold-chrome futuristic visor that completely covers the eyes and wraps around the temples. The visor reflects the surrounding environment with a distorted, mirror-like finish. the person is wearing a matte black high-neck turtleneck under a dark, textured overcoat. Accessories include multiple heavy, layered gold Cuban-link chains around the neck, a small gold hoop earring. The background is a soft-focus, muted olive-green wall with a slight industrial patina. Lighting is cinematic and moody, featuring a soft key light from the side that emphasizes the smooth skin texture and the sharp specular highlights on the gold jewelry and visor. The camera is at eye-level, using a 100mm macro lens to capture extreme detail in the lips, skin pores, and the intricate reflections on the chrome surfaces.
