Medium-shot fashion photograph of a person seated at a mint-green laminate table in a retro-inspired diner setting. the person is wearing a massive, oversized white faux-fur coat with deep pile and visible soft texture. they are holding a silver spoon and are positioned next to a large purple bowl of cereal and a customized cereal box with vibrant graphics. The background is a teal-blue wood-paneled wall featuring a simple analog silver clock. A glass bottle of milk sits in the foreground with a deliberate white spill on the table. The lighting is flat and bright, characteristic of 90s-era commercial photography, with a cool-toned ambient fill that emphasizes the whiteness of the fur and the saturation of the teal and purple. The camera is at a slightly high angle, creating a playful, exaggerated perspective with sharp focus across the subject and the props.
