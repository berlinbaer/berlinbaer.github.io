A profile-view fashion portrait of a person wearing a highly complex, monochromatic white head-piece that blends traditional ornate lace patterns with futuristic hardware. The head-piece features a large, rectangular white headphone-like apparatus on the side with various buttons and silver grilles, integrated into an intricate, carved crown and a high-neck lace collar that covers the entire throat. The textures are a mix of delicate floral embroidery, beaded pearls, and smooth industrial plastic. The person has a sharp, editorial makeup look with a heavy winged eyeliner and a matte nude lip. The background is a soft, neutral gray. The lighting is a soft-box studio setup that highlights the three-dimensional depth of the white-on-white textures. The camera uses an 85mm lens for a crisp, compressed portrait with high-fashion clarity.
