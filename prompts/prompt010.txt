A hyper-realistic outdoor street-style fashion portrait of a person standing mid-stride on a cobblestone walkway, captured full-body with a slight diagonal composition. the person is wearing a deep green cable-knit sweater layered over a white collared shirt, loose burnt-orange corduroy trousers, orange-and-white low-profile sneakers, a matching green knit beanie, white rectangular sunglasses, and a structured orange leather crossbody bag worn high across the chest. The background features soft-focus architectural steps and a passerby rendered as motion blur, reinforcing depth and lifestyle context. Lighting is natural overcast daylight, diffused and even, with soft shadows and accurate color rendering. Shot on a full-frame camera with an 85mm lens, camera positioned at chest height and angled slightly upward to elongate posture. The subject is sharply in focus while the background falls into a creamy blur. Color palette is cohesive and fashion-forward, emphasizing greens and oranges with clean neutrals. The overall mood is polished, contemporary, and editorial, resembling high-end street fashion photography with crisp realism and balanced exposure.
