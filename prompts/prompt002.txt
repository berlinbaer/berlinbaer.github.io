A front-facing minimalist fashion portrait of a person wearing a sleek, transparent glass-like visor that wraps across the bridge of the nose and temples. The visor features a vivid, hyper-realistic reflection of a bright blue sky and white wildflowers, contrasting sharply with the dark background. the person is dressed in a crisp, cream-colored ribbed turtleneck. The lighting is harsh and directional, mimicking direct sunlight, which casts distinct, diagonal shadows across the person's face and the fabric of the turtleneck. The person’s skin has a natural, slightly damp sheen as if from light perspiration. The camera is positioned at a direct eye-level with a medium-close framing, using a 50mm lens for a grounded, realistic perspective. The background is an infinite, solid obsidian black, making the subject and the reflection in the visor the sole focus.
